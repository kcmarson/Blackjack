# Blackjack
Simple Program to Practice Java Programming
A program in progress that will allow a user to simulate playing a hand of blackjack

Known Bugs:
Hand.java's toString method currently bugged. There is an ArrayIndexOutofBounds throw resulting from within the for loop. One possible solution is to investigate the vector.java methods for a method that will execute a command on all elements within the vector.
